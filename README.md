## Goal
The purpose of this project is to predict number of bike rental for days, hours.

## Data
Input data is csv file that includes number of bike sharing for days, hours, weekdays, weather etc
For feeding this data to Neuaral Net and tunning weights, we need to some data tunnings

## Features
The data prediction is done using NeuralNet architecture trained by rental shop sales data. The main difficulty is to set proper parameters like: architecture, loss function and tuned hyperparameters like learning rate, epochs, hidden nodes. In this project I used Machine Learning framework like TensorFlow and Keras.
